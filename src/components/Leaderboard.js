                Here we shows the results of EBenchAttacker attacking different LLMs. We tested
                both open source LLMs and commercial LLMs and calculated ASR(Attack Success Rate, %)
                respectively. Note that some attacks might <span style={{fontWeight: 600}}>not be
                able</span> to work on commercial LLMs. Thus we might apply a "Transfer Attack" on
                these LLMs. Here we use dataset <span style={{fontWeight: 600, color: "#E86253"}}>
                "EBench-small"</span>. You may conduct a more comprehensive experiment on larger
                datasets we provided.
